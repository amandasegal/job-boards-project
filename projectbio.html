			<p>Hi there! My name is Amanda Segal, and when I'm not watching Game of Thrones, I am a Support Engineer at Greenhouse Software. Greenhouse is a recruiting optimization platform. As a part of our platform, we host our customers' job boards, which can be integrated with their own careers page. You may have seen examples of this in the wild here, here, and here. Among my responsibilities is troubleshooting and advising on our job board integrations options with customers. As a part of my own development, I thought it would be a great challenge to actually build a website and host one of these job boards on my own.</p>
			<p>One of our job board integration options is an embedded iframe, which you will see on my TDT Careers page: INSERT LINK. This is one of our out-of-the-box integration options, which does not require as much technical expertise. The CSS applied to this iframe is actually uploaded through my own Greenhouse demo account, which you may have guessed by now, is called Targaryen Dragon Trainers. I hope you enjoy navigating this site, which is comprised of six mobile responsive pages, including Testimonials, Pricing, Product, About Us, Careers, and Contact. My immediate focus for this project was on the site layout, design, and build, but you can look forward to more original written content in the future!</p>
			<p>You may have noticed the original title for this site was "Job Boards Project". This is because Greenhouse also offers API-driven job board integration options. My long term goal for this project to keep coding and increase the complexity of this site, including building an API-driven job board. I hope you have as much fun exploring this site as I did building it!</p>
			<p>- Amanda</p>
